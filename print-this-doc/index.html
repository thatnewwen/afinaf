      Dear Printer: I hope this document finds you well. There are some things that are better said—or printed—here. This is a space for the sort of things that need texture and dimension. Here we can write things that have weight, paper weight and symbolic weight. There is a permenance in these lines that the digital world can't quite hold on to, something that only tangibility permits. At the same time, unlike virtual words that can be broadcasted to the world and spread like wildfire, these words are more like secrets—free to exist only here and now. Burn this after reading, or save it in a binder in the attic, this document is with you.
