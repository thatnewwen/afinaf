            <p>There must be a certain arrogance to drawing a circle. A shape so perfect, drawn by a hand so imperfect. </p>
<p>The first few circles felt odd to draw. Then, I realized that I was drawing the circle counter-clockwise, when I usually go clockwise. It&#39;s been so long since I drew a circle, I just wasn&#39;t sure.</p>
<p>After 40 or so circles, I realized the pencil strokes were getting thicker as the tip was getting more dull, I re-adjusted the angle and continued. </p>
<p>After 100 or so circles, I started to see a really nice round shape, one that closely resembles the circle that comes to mind when I think about the shape. And at that point, I lost interest in making the idealized circle. I started drawing them more rapidly, more loosely. There can only be one perfect circle, there can be so many imperfect ones. </p>
