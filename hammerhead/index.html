            <p>There is one way of doing things, and there is the other way of doing things. But what if there's a secret third way, a way of doing both, or neither. Even without knowing what thing we're talking about, there is some intrigue on this third path, because it's not about the thing itself, it's about the choice. It's about the ability to think beyond the binary.</p>

              <p>At least, that's what I was thinking about while reading about hammerhead sharks. When it comes to vision, most animals either have eyes positions on the side of their head, to see more of their surroundings, or in front of their head, to better gauge depth and distance on a more narrow field. This is why most predator animals are the latter, and the animals that are usually prey are the former. But what if those weren't the only choices, what else is possible? The hammerhead shark has a bit of both, by changing it's head shape, a new possibility emerges.</p>
