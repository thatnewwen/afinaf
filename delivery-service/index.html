            <h2>Details</h2>
<p>A monthly delivery service that featured—</p>
<ul>
<li>Three (3) 4x6 photo prints, as part of an iterative exhibition, a glimmer of the ordinary</li>
<li>A bonus item or two: a bonus print, a zine, a drawing, a part of the process—printed</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve long been frustrated with the options we have when it comes to sharing our art and creativity, social media posts that are highly dependent on the whims of the algorithm or submission to institutional art spaces (galleries, museums, etc). These existing systems only understand art and creativity as products, where does that leave the process? </p>
<p>What does it mean to create an exhibition on process? </p>
<p>Maybe the delivery, this network of letters sent and received is the exhibition. Maybe eventually these photos will come together—forming a larger picture, then each letter is an iterative step towards a larger exhibition. Maybe you will take some of the photos and tape them on the wall or shove them in a drawer, and then an exhibition now lives in your dwelling. Maybe it&#39;s a bit of everything, when we remove the walls, boundaries, borders that define these spaces, it opens up room for abundance and multitudes. </p>
<p>These three photos are the start of an exhibition, but hopefully they can also be an invitation to continue our exploration into alternative methods of sharing and supporting. Instead of competing for likes, can we build models that allow us to share more process, and share more intimately? Instead of bouncing between the solitary struggle of freelancing or the restrictive confines of a 9-to-5, can we explore ways of sustaining each other that gives us more flexibility to be autonomous and human? </p>
<p>These seemingly disparate ideas and goals are actually the same, our desire to create rubs directly against how capitalism functions, and not only that, the most aspirational form of creativity is to have it as a force to imagine and manifest a better world, one without capitalism. The photos I share (and the ones everyone takes on their cameras, phones, etc) are a practice in observation, a snapshot in creating realities, and the sharing of them, having all of you see what you see in these photos, are an invitation in co-creating a better world. The practice of making, the work on creating the channels to share the creation, the conversations that come out of it, they are all tied together. </p>
