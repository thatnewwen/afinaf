            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>I love the fact that the rising moon can often feel like an event, one of amazement and mystery. The sense of wonder that it looks larger than usual, larger than possible. Even as we know the &quot;truth&quot;, that the moon is no closer or further, our eyes perceive a different truth. But what&#39;s more interesting is that this illusion is strangely unsolved? </p>
<p>The Moon illusion feels like a simple case of context, when the moon is lower, it is seen next to the horizon, along with mountains, or trees, or buildings, references that would then contextualize the size of the moon, as opposed to its overhead position, isolated from other things to compare to. And yet, NASA astronauts in orbit see this Moon illusion too, even as they have no additional foreground objects to reference. The Ponzo illusion, and how we perceive the horizon and curvature of the sky may all play a part in how we see a different truth, but there&#39;s actually no consensus or certainty on why it appears that way to us. The reality is different, and the journey is unknown. For our reality to be shattered every month (obviously more like every day, but I feel like this illusion is most noteworthy on full moons), to respond with continued astonishment, there is beauty in that.</p>
