            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>In <a href="https://aflowerisnotaflower.com/mall/index.html">Making All Lobbies Liminal</a>, one example of a mall that could be imagined and manifested was the virtual mall, building out a space in a virtual arena, where the barrier of entry is lower. With <a href="https://aflowerisnotaflower.com/infinite-oasis/index.html">infinite oasis</a>, the central premise revolved around a multitude of blogs, where each blog can not only cover different things, but can take shape as various forms. </p>
            <p>Infinite Blocks brings the two ideas together, a regular build session with a group of people, imagining what a world being built together would look like. Think of it as a blog that one can walk in. Or as a virtual mall one can browse through. </p>
            <p>Minecraft was the original game that people would build in, thanks to it&#39;s simple, but expansive building capabilities, but similar games like Terraria or even something in Roblox might fulfill the same idea while also adhering to the BDS call for boycott of Microsoft. </p>
            <p>In these crafting games, people can work together to create the garden of their dreams, or they can create a pop-up exhibition of sculptures, or they could build a virtual library that houses poems and essays. The core idea is that even if the building is virtual, the work of shaping a world together can translate across mediums to reality. Planning a shared garden, or designating roles on a grand fountain project require teamwork, setting norms, and negotiating values in ways that can offer some guidance into how these things would play out in real life. </p>
            <p>The construction of a virtual world with a group of people, not only offers a glimpse into what&#39;s possible, it is a sliver of that utopia in practice. It&#39;s the sketch, the blueprint, the process, the motivation, the gathering space for the IRL version to become a reality. And at the end of the day, even if you can&#39;t touch it, by building a virtual world together—a world is still built together. </p>
