            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>There&#39;s few musicians I replay more than Frank Ocean. His melodies not only transport, but immerse. It&#39;s either a comfort or a curse to be trapped in the cycles of love and loss, to be trapped in never-ending summer. Or to flip over what could have been, only to flip it back, and then over once more. The repetition provides a comfort, and it can be a source of agitation. </p>
<p>In &quot;Seigfried&quot;, Frank Ocean is orbiting, going around in circles contemplating whether to land somewhere, or to simply drift off. Then he has this moment:</p>
<p>Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought<br>That could think of the dreamer that thought<br>That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God<br>I be dreaming a dream in a thought<br>That could dream about a thought<br>That could think of dreaming a dream<br>Where I cannot, where I cannot</p>
<p>It&#39;s almost like he&#39;s recalling a dream right after waking up, making sure to blurt out the details before it floats off into a dreamy haze. I started hearing the repetition in words and rhymes, the cycles of reminiscing or ruminating, of recollecting or reburying. Then, I mapped the cycles.</p>
