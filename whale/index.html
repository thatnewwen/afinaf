            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>On production, a piece of paper does not know its final printed form, it may become a coloring book or a lunch menu. In this case, these pages became part of a magazine for LifeWear, a lifestyle magazine by Uniqlo used to advertised their clothing. </p>
<p>On production, a roll of photographic film does not know how it will react to the light and produce the negatives it does, it may become a hiking viewpoint or a portrait of a friend. Here, it is a photo of a humpback whale from a whale watching tour I was on in Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>But even these finished states are just as fluid as their initial states. A page from LifeWear can continue its journey, from marketing content to a print medium for a photograph. The photos that were meant for editorial content is now texture and style for a new work of art. </p>
<p>Some of the journey could also be purely accidental. It&#39;s hard to see in the images here, but the photo of the whale is covered in a pattern of lines called reticulation. It happens when there is a mistake in the development process of the film, where the temperature change happens too quickly. Perhaps its a lesson in what happens when one outsources a part of the process, or it&#39;s an unexpected (and unwelcome) collaborator entering the journey of the art object. Ether way, it&#39;s now woven into the story of the item. </p>
<p>Now, it&#39;s arrived in its current form, as a GIF that I&#39;m sharing here. </p>
