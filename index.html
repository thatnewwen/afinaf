              <p>a flower is not a flower has been a phrase that has been bouncing around in my head for years since I read Thich Nhat Hanh using it as a allegory for interconnectedness. “It is made only of non-flower elements—sunshine, clouds, time, space, earth, minerals, gardeners, and so on. A true flower contains the whole universe. If we return any one of these non-flower elements to its source, there will be no flower.” At the time, it was an essential phrase in my meditative practice, a way to tackle intense anxiety—how do I overcome the loneliness and isolation I felt, how do I confront the inevitability of death, how do  . Since then, it&#39;s been a connective tissue in understanding  why I create, and how to create. </p>
<p>a flower is not a flower is a manifesto of sorts. It might also be a structure or super-structure on how we might organize our creative projects. But it&#39;s also much simpler than that, I think when I say a flower is not a flower, I think about what it means to dig a little deeper into the world around us, to think a little more about how things can be. I&#39;m drawn to the idea of exploring our interconnectedness, or rejecting linearity. I want to lean into abundance and multitudes, muscles that I find are strengthened through both creative practice and engaging with creative work. a flower is not a flower is thinking about radical as in root, and how that intersects with creativity. How at its core creativity can be a means to bring about change, how creativity is a way of expression and communication. </p>
<p>For now, a flower is not a flower is a weekly newsletter. I will be sharing the process and the practice, sketches of ideas, summaries of past events, and my perspective on contributions in broader groups, collectives, and communities. Optimistically, I hope this grows directly and indirectly into more people exploring and sharing their process and practice in deeper ways as well. For other people to create self-archives and document, and write, and map—or simply to affirm those that are already doing so, or to support those exploring how they might organize their own processes. Maybe it will be a flower is not a flower for them too, or maybe something else, maybe a star is not a star, or a balloon is not a balloon. Maybe someone might even just say a flower is a flower. </p>
