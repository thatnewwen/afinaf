              <p>A friend once told me that when there are two dots and a line, people usually associate the diagram as an illustration of a friendship. Later, when I asked him for more information or a source, he said he made it up, but the idea stuck. </p>
              <p>It is interesting how two dots and a line can look like a friendship. I really love simple, minimal design, they have an elegance where the building blocks are visible. You see the dots and lines and you can see exactly how it was composed. </p>
              <p>Here I&#39;ve created 10 scenarios between two dots and some lines. </p>

              <p>My first full-time job after college was working with spreadsheets. I was a sourcing analyst, where my job was to maintain spreadsheets with a parts list, like for the electronic parts of a washing machine or something. My daily task would be to send the parts list to a list of different distributors, and they would send back the spreadsheets with their prices filled out for each part: 3 cents for a resistor, 10 cents for a capacitor, etc. Then, I would compile all the prices onto one large spreadsheet and then submit that to my project manager for them to make purchases. It was honestly a terrible job, but there was something there. </p>
<p>When I was deep in a spreadsheet, something seemed to have clicked. It was like seeing the bricks to a building. The simple elegance of a spreadsheet, data arranged into a table, made working on it feel like tinkering with the base elements of some technological compound. Of course, our usual interactions with spreadsheets are usually no fun. They either function as a successor to the accounting books they were built off of, or they pop up as finance tools or school assignments. </p>
<p>But what happens if we imagine the the tabular form as a creative canvas? What happens when we give life to each cell?</p>
