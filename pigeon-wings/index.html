           <p>I don&#39;t say this often, but I actually wish this video was longer. I was waiting for someone or something and just standing around when I saw this pigeon strolling around in this fenced area for a few minutes. It did the thing that pigeons do where there&#39;s a lot of pacing, then stopping and starting. It looked like it couldn&#39;t get out of the enclosure, stopping every time it got to the edge and turning around. Of course, that&#39;s absurd because how did it get in? </p>
<p>So I turned on my camera and about the time I did so, the pigeon decided to fly out. Maybe the pigeon had its fill and was done hanging out there, maybe the pigeon was spooked by a nearby passing car (which you hear) and decided to leave. Or maybe the pigeon flew out right after the camera came on to prove to all the witnesses that they can leave whenever they want. Or it&#39;s the other way around, with the camera on, the pigeon is reminded of the wings they always had. Cinema as a projection or as a reflection. Cinema as a call to action, as a call to lift off. </p>
