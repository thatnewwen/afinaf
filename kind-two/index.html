            <p>A quick phone snap from the balcony of a museum becomes the foundation of this poster. The curvy, white walls of the museum provide a natural frame for the subjects walking underneath. In a building full of observing the framing, it&#39;s interesting to create it. </p>
<p>So much of art as its presented under capitalism is framed as a thing to be consumed, rather than one in which most people can participate in. We attend an art gallery, we watch a movie, we show up to a concert, they&#39;re all meaningful activities, but there&#39;s often little room for us to make the art, shoot the film, jam with the instruments. Even when it happens, they get relegated to hobbies, amateur work not on the same level as the art we often consume. For the vast majority of people, if they love theater, the answer is to be a bigger fan, attend more shows, buy more merchandise, funnels that obviously make the rich richer, when the more obvious direction is to have more people participate, for more art forms to be accessible. Elevate the amateur as the primary representative of a form, for a reality in which art in deeply entangled with our being, and not just as a commodity. </p>
