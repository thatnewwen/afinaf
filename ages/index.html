            <p>A design inspired by older playing cards. </p>
        <p>I think too much of modern design is dominated by circles—perfect symmetry that scales well, but really seems to be embraced because a circle is easy to create virtually (or at least a really good approximation of a circle). But as 652 Circles revealed, when it comes to handcrafted work, perhaps the oval is more relatable. Using the oval as an anchor, and joining them for a heart, I spelled out ages. </p>
        <p>What is timeless in our present reality, what is not? Sometimes it feels like all the things that we want to last, our photos on Flickr, our favorite neighborhood diner, are doomed to never last. Meanwhile, our &quot;criminal&quot; records—the way we&#39;re tracked and surveilled, they never seem to get erased. When colonial powers dictate time, do we ever want to be eternal or timeless in it? </p>
