            <p>The more I try to escape it, the more I get pulled back. While it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve lived in the suburbs, the legacy of suburbia and what it represents for US urban design continues to haunt me daily. And yet, since I grew up in the suburbs, the setting is deeply embedded in so many meaningful moments in my life, nostalgic hang outs and first crushes. </p>
<p>It was home, but it was unwelcome. It&#39;s familiar, even as its also alienating. The reality of suburbia is this constant role-playing, the performance of a progressive society, the act of neighborly communities. </p>
<p>I made a list of things I would do in the suburbs, things I&#39;ve done, things I&#39;ve yet to do, and things I feel someone in the suburbs might do. If someone follows this list, then they will know what it&#39;s like to live in the suburbs.</p>
