            <h2>Details</h2>
<p>Building off some of the ideas of Time + Paper, the promise of stationery is given another chance. While an unused planner or empty journal might usually feel like a disappointing artifact, a symbol of failed potential. Here it is a canvas for art. In some ways, this reclamation might be a better use of the tree that became this paper than whatever would have filled the planner. So many of the objects we are surrounded by are produced with the purpose of capitalist productivity in mind, perhaps even more so in the case of the planner, an object produced with the purpose of helping one be more productive. The purpose of art might be to re-wild, reclaim, repurpose, and revitalize these objects. Similar to electronic whalefall, how can we take individual (like an unfinished planner) and structural failings (like the waste of office supplies) from capitalist production and use them as seeds, and plans, for a better world. </p>
<p>(Also, there&#39;s something really appealing about applying dots to a grid, circles to squares, like pixels but I&#39;m cheating because this is tactile and this is in curves and rounds. In some ways, this is a physical form of The Tabular Form.)</p>
