    <title>A website that takes place entirely in this tab. A virtual crawlspace that is usually reserved for just the title, but it's actually surprisingly spacious here. There is plenty of room for other thoughts. Of course, this isn't the intended usage of this section. This is usually where the title resides, a short descriptor of the page or the site. But when so many websites are dictated by profit, when the virtual architecture we create prioritizes endless commercial endeavors, then perhaps there's a little something to repurposing these parts and places. Brick by brick, byte by byte, can we imagine something beyond, beyond technology as we understand it. Like a website where all the content does not reside on the page itself, but in its title. A declaration of beyond.</title>
